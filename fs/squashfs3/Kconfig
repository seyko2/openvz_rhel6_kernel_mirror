	  Saying Y here includes support for SquashFS 3.1 (a Compressed
	  Read-Only File System).  Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only
	  filesystem for Linux.  It uses zlib compression to compress both
	  files, inodes and directories.  Inodes in the system are very small
	  and all blocks are packed to minimise data overhead. Block sizes
	  greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 1 Mbytes (default
	  block size 128K).  SquashFS 4.0 supports 64 bit filesystems and files
	  (larger than 4GB), full uid/gid information, hard links and
	  timestamps.  

	  Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for
	  archival use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in
	  embedded systems where low overhead is needed.  Further information
	  and tools are available from http://squashfs.sourceforge.net.

	  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
	  will be called squashfs.  Note that the root file system (the one
	  containing the directory /) cannot be compiled as a module.

	  If unsure, say N.
